\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter we evaluate Storm-MC. We do this by comparing its performance against the local mode of Apache Storm.

\section{Performance}

\subsection{Software Setup}

\todo{Change versions below as applicable. Link to GitHub for source?}

All performance benchmarks were ran using the following software packages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Apache Storm version 0.9.2
	\item Storm-MC version 0.1.5
	\item A fork of IBM Storm Email Benchmarks version 0.1.4
	\item Storm-benchmark version 0.1.0
\end{itemize}

The Apache Storm source code had to be adapted to include a workaround for a deadlock bug present in version 0.9.2. This bug caused a topology to exit with threads left in Zombie state under certain conditions. This prevented Storm from logging the benchmark metrics after execution.

Version 0.1.5 is the latest version of Storm-MC as of this moment. The first release was version 0.1.0 which was production-ready but since then there were 5 minor versions fixing bugs as they were discovered during testing.

IBM open sourced a suite of benchmarks which they used to compare Apache Storm to their real-time stream system IBM Infosphere Streams. These benchmarks were adapted and used to benchmark Apache Storm and Storm-MC.

Lastly, a number of spout and bolt components were used from the storm-benchmark project which Apache Storm developers use to benchmark Storm.

Since Storm-MC reuses package names from Apache Storm, the same benchmark is directly executable by both libraries. This saved a lot of time and furthermore there is no need to maintain two benchmarks suites.

\todo{Go into more detail which components were re-used and where?}

\subsection{Hardware Setup}

The benchmarks were executed on the following hardware:

\todo{This is currently student.compute, find out what it is.}

\subsection{WordCount Topology}

The first topology we tested for performance is a variant of the aforementioned WordCount topology. Recall, that this topology is shown graphically on figure \ref{fig:wordcount_topology}. The topology was ran with 3 executors running for every component.

This topology is considered to be CPU-intensive.

\end{figure}


\end{knitrout}


\subsection{Enron Topology}

Next, we tested the Enron topology from the IBM benchmarks. In this topology, serialised emails from the Enron email database are read from a file by a spout. They are further deserialised by one bolt, filtered by another bolt, modified by yet another bolt and then finally metrics are recorded by another bolt.

Similarly, to the WordCount topology this topology is serial in nature. However, whereas the WordCount topology keeps the random sentences in memory, the Enron topology reads from a file. Thus, this benchmark is mostly I/O intensive.

\subsection{RollingSort Topology}

The RollingSort topology is ported over from the aforementioned storm-benchmark project. This topology includes one spout and one bolt. The spout produces hundred character-long strings of random digits from zero to eight. The bolt stores a rolling window of hundred of these messages and sorts them every \textbf{x} seconds.

This benchmark is included because it is considered memory-intensive.

\todo{change x depending on the actual benchmark.}

\section{Challenges}

In this section we are going to discuss challenges we encountered while porting Apache Storm to multi-core machines.
