\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

In recent years, there has been an explosion of cloud computing software. After Google published their paper on MapReduce \citep{dean2010mapreduce}, many new open-source frameworks for distributed computation have emerged, most notably Apache Hadoop \citep{ApacheHadoop} for batch processing and Apache Storm \citep{ApacheStorm} for real-time data stream processing.

The main idea of these frameworks is to split the work that needs to be carried out and distribute it across nodes of a cluster. Commercial companies and researchers have been able to utilise these frameworks and create distributed systems which can accomplish things that would not be otherwise possible. This has mostly been allowed by the low price and good horizontal scaling properties of commodity hardware.

%\todo{Quote that they are standard.}

At the same time, chip makers have been increasing the number of cores in processors and now we are at a point where servers with 10-core processors are standard. Moreover, most high-end servers support multiple processor sockets thus furthering the parallelisation possible with a single machine even more.

The price of multi-core servers has been going down as well. In 2008, a typical Hadoop node had two dual-core processors and 4 GB of random access memory (RAM). Nowadays, a server with two eight-core processors and 256 GB of RAM can be purchased for roughly \$10,000 USD \citep{Kumar:2013:HSD:2536274.2536314}. Hence a single server today might have better processing power than a small cluster from a few years ago \citep{Kumar:2013:HSD:2536274.2536314}.

Even though the cost of a commodity hardware cluster might be lower than the price of a single computer with equal power there are certain limitations. These limitations are further explored in section \ref{sec:multicore}.

\section{Main Idea}

The main idea of this report is to take the existing Apache Storm project and port it to multi-core. This is implemented in Storm-MC - a library with an API compatible with Apache Storm. This allows programmers to take an existing application written with Apache Storm in mind and run it on a multi-core server. This way, we can avoid network latency and enjoy the significant performance improvements of a shared-memory environment.
